Data File Mod is a mod, where every 5 seconds, in data.json file, you get some information on your player to let external program (like discord bots) use your player data.

## exemple use :

making real AFK farms that send you a message when your health is under a certain cap,
counting how efficient is your coin farm
making fun game with friend where you can see inventory of other

and so much more !

you can extract and modify the mod as you wish !
but if you want to add something that could be useful, feel free to do push request on the mod's [github repositories]( https://github.com/TheGeekMax/DataFileMod )

if you want to contact me, you can DM me on discord with WikiMax#2875 (you have to be on Terraria official discord or tmodloader to be sure i won't block you)

have fun using this mod !
